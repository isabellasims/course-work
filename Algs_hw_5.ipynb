Since everytime we move a name it will need to be resorted alphabetically, we ideally would do these steps when the system is most active. If the frequency of name look-ups changes often, we would want to do this more frequently. We should also weigh the time it takes to resort the table vs the time we save by doing so. We only want to resort the table if it saves us time. \n",
